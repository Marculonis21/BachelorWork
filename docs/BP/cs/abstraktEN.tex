This work introduces a system for configuring and evaluating experiments with
evolutionary algorithms in 3D simulated physical environments of the
\emph{MuJoCo} library. Experiments allow the development of the control and
morphology of robots while using arbitrary user-defined fitness functions. The
implementation was designed to be as accessible, understandable, and extendable
as possible. The system offers a simple graphical user interface allowing a
granular configuration of experiments and a text-based user interface which is
convenient for running large amounts of experiments for statistical analysis.
The work implements a few robots of increasing difficulties, examples of
different evolutionary algorithms, and a selection of well-known genetic
operators. While creating experiments, the architecture of this system allows
the creation of different combinations of all elements. This work and the user
documentation give simple instructions on how to alter and extend the
implementation.
