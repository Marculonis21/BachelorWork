\begin{document}
This work introduces a system for designing and evaluating experiments with
evolutionary algorithms in 3D-simulated physical environments of the MuJoCo
library. Experiments allow to develop the control and morphology of robots
while using arbitrary user-defined fitness functions. The implementation was
designed to be as accessible, understandable, and extendable as possible. The
system offers a simple graphical user interface allowing a detailed
configuration of experiments and a text-based user interface which is
convenient for running large amounts of experiments for statistical analysis.
The work implements several robots of different complexity, examples of various
evolutionary algorithms, and a selection of well-known genetic operators.
During experiment design, the architecture of this system allows the combining
of implemented operators and tools arbitrarily. This work and the user
documentation give simple instructions on how to alter and extend the
implementation.
